## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting opinions and emotions from textual data, and classifying them in different classes such as positive, negative, or neutral. 

## Comparative Study

In this project, we executed a comparative study on sentiment analysis using NLTK/VADER SpaCy/Textblob, and HuggingFace. We analyzed the results obtained from two versions of code. These versions had slightly different approaches to the task regarding the preprocessing steps. Preprocessing techniques such as lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization, and stop-word removal are crucial steps that refine raw text, extract meaningful features, improving the data quality, and ultimately enhancing the performance of sentiment analysis tasks. The results of these 2 versions and 3 different models were presented, visualized and discussed in the project report.
